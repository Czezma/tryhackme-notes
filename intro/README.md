# Intro Notes

These are my introductory TryHackMe notes.

This section covers the **Pre-Security** module of the TryHackMe learning path.

Topics included:
- Networking fundamentals  
- Windows fundamentals  
- Linux fundamentals  
- Basic command-line usage  
- Introductory security concepts

These notes I have made serve as the foundation for the more advanced modules in this repository.
